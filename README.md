### Manual Installation (Community Plugins not available yet)
1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Extract the files to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/remote-fetch/` folder
3. Enable the plugin in Obsidian's Community Plugins settings

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P) and search for "Download file from URL"
2. Or use the ribbon icon (if enabled)
3. Enter the URL of the file you want to download
4. Choose a filename (auto-filled from URL)
5. Select a destination folder
6. Click "Download"

### Command

## Settings

The plugin offers several configuration options:

- **Default Download Folder**: Set a default folder for all downloads (leave empty for root folder)
- **Enable CORS Proxy**: Toggle CORS proxy usage to bypass cross-origin restrictions
- **CORS Proxy URL**: Configure your custom CORS proxy URL

## CORS Proxy Setup

Many websites block direct file downloads due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. This plugin includes support for CORS proxies to bypass these limitations.

### Default Proxy
The plugin comes with a default CORS proxy: `https://remote-fetch.shaharyar.dev/?url=`


### Custom Proxy
You can set up your own CORS proxy using Cloudflare Workers or similar services. The proxy should:
1. Accept a URL parameter
2. Fetch the content from that URL
3. Return it with appropriate CORS headers

#### Example: Safe Cloudflare Worker Script

The full source code for a safe CORS proxy is included in [`cors-proxy-worker.js`](./cors-proxy-worker.js) in this repository.
**This code is designed to be as safe as possible:**

- Only allows public internet URLs (blocks localhost, private IPs, etc.)
- Handles CORS preflight requests
- Limits file size (50MB max)
- Copies only safe headers
- Sets strict CORS headers on all responses
- Does NOT log, store, or analyze any data

You can review the code directly in this repository. It is safe for use as a public CORS proxy for file downloads.

```javascript
// See cors-proxy-worker.js for the full, up-to-date code
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    // ...existing code as in cors-proxy-worker.js...
  }
};
```


## Supported File Types

The plugin automatically detects and handles various file types:
- Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX
- Images: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG
- Text: TXT, MD, JSON
- Archives: ZIP
- Media: MP4, MP3, WAV
- And many more...

## Error Handling

The plugin provides detailed error messages for common issues:
- Network connectivity problems
- CORS-related errors
- Invalid URLs
- File already exists
- Empty or invalid downloads

## Development

### Prerequisites
